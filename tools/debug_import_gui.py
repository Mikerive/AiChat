# Removed debug helper.
# This file was used temporarily during development to stream GUI import
# tracebacks to the terminal. It has been removed per request â€” please use
# the official startup script `python start_gui.py` to launch the GUI.
#
# If you need the debug helper again later, it can be restored from VCS.
